These are a few of the projects I currently work on in my spare time:

## [boot.rackspace.com](http://boot.rackspace.com)

boot.rackspace.com is a collection of [iPXE](http://www.ipxe.org) scripts that allow you to rapidly network boot Operating Systems, Utilities and other tools very easily. It allows you the flexibility of booting installations without having to go track down and download installation media. It's especially useful for remote access environments when you don't want to utilize remote attach CD in a Dell DRAC, HP iLO or some other type of remote tool. It's especially awesome for bootstrapping your own custom installation on a Cloud Server!

## [netboot.xyz](http://netboot.xyz)
A fork of boot.rackspace.com, I created netboot.xyz to provide a more generic and easy to remember location for netbooting images and to allow for more experimentation and operating system options.
